This web application displays Clyde Riverfly Monitoring Partnership (CRIMP) data collected by volunteers. Volunteers collect information about invertebrate river life using the Riverfly methodology. This involves taking a 'kick' sample using a handnet from a river and recording the abundance of invertebrates found for 8 different groups/types of invertebrate. Only trained volunteers may undertaken this sampling.

The web application uses this architecture:

* Site detail information is entered on
*Data is uploaded to the site via a Google form and then stored in a Google spreadsheet which can be found here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArVD_Gwut6UBdHZkQ2g0U0NXQ0psZUltQkpKZjVEM3c&single=true&gid=0&output=csv


The web app downloads the google spreadsheet and creates an interactive website. The files which create the app and handle user interactions are ui.R and server.R scripts using shiny server package from RStudio.
