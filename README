This web application displays Clyde Riverfly Monitoring Partnership (CRIMP) data collected by volunteers. Volunteers collect information about invertebrate river life using the Riverfly methodology. This involves taking a 'kick' sample using a handnet from a river and recording the abundance of invertebrates found for 8 different groups/types of invertebrate. Only trained volunteers may undertaken this sampling.

The web app downloads a google spreadsheet and creates an interactive website. The files which creates the app and handle user interactions are ui.R and server.R scripts using shiny server package from RStudio. Read more about the architecture/workflow in the Architeture.md doc.
